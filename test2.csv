"DEFENCE IN CYBERSPACE    LESSONS FROM RUSSIA UKRAINE WAR  ",
"Russian invasion in  Ukraine was  envisaged  as a modern conflict between t wo technological ",
"advance d nation s. Many analysts  were of the view that this would be a high -tech  war where both ",
"the nation states would employ their state of art arsenal including cyber weapons. However ",
"Cyber -Armageddon is yet to be witnessed . ",
"Russia is an established cyber power  with proven cyber -attack  capabilities . Previously, in 2014 ",
"during Crimea annexation campaign Russia n Federation  was able to launch significant cyber -",
"attacks  to undermine cy ber  defence capabilities  of Ukrain e. During this campaign, Russian ",
"hackers crippled  banking system to inflict economic loss as well as defaced official websites to  ",
"undermine the will of people of Ukraine. The Federation used wormable  malware which had ",
"capability to affect cross domain networks by jumping from one domain to another. However ",
"this malware also affected networks outside of Ukraine.  Russia also used its cyber capabilities ",
"during conflict with Georgia in 2007. These cyber -attacks pre ceded  military campaign and ",
"helped to create a favorable environment by overloading Georgian government official computer ",
"networks  ",
"Ukrain e once having third largest stockpile of nuclear arsenal , opted for denuclearization under ",
"Budapest Memorandum  in 1994 . The Budapest Memorandum consists of a series of political ",
"assurances whereby the signatory states commit to “respect the independence and sovereig nty ",
"and the existing borders of Ukraine ”. According to this memorandum the U.S., Great Britain and ",
"Russia offered security assurances to the nation that had won independence when the  erstwhile  ",
"Soviet Union dissolved . ",
"However due to anarchic character of internationa l political system, states tend  to maximize their ",
"power by adjusting their policies. Moreover offence defence theory  highlights the importance of ",
"hardened defence to maintain status quo. Thus weakening of defence of Ukraine proved  ",
"incentive for   Russian  invasion , previously in 2014 when annexation of Crimea took place and ",
"again in 2022, Russia invaded with more power  and broader objective . Neverthe less,  Ukrain e ",
"responded well particularly in cyber realm Ukraine  defended  vehemently  with the assistance  of ",
"allied countries and their private tech companies . ",
"During ongoing conflict, Russia has tried to keep conflict limited to Ukraine geographical ",
"boundaries . Hence,  now cyber -attacks  intended against cyber infrastructures are  only targeting ",
"those networks  and other cyber infrastructures  which are geographically  residing inside Ukraine.  ",
"These cyber -attacks  are mainly intended  for denial of service, espionage, data extracti on and data ",
"destruction activities . T he Federation  is also harnessing cyber capabilities for influencing ",
"operations . These operations are engaging domestic audience to muster support for the ",
"government policies , against  Ukraine populace to undermine their  will as  a nation and prepare  ",
"them to  pursue their government to refrain from further  resistan ce and influencing other nation  ",
"states  to dissuade them to support Ukrainian . ",
"Whereas, Ukraine is quite successful to impede  cyber -attacks directed against its cyber ",
"infrastructures, Russian influence operation have reportedly impacted domestic  audience as well ",
"as abroad specially areas which  are against colonialism such as Africa.  ",
" Russian cyber influence operations are building on and are connected to tactics developed for ",
"other cyber activities. Like the Advance Persistence Threat  teams that work withi n Russian ",
"intelligence services , Advance  Persistent Manipulator (APM) teams associated with Russian ",
"government agencies act through social media and digital platforms.  ",
" ",
"These actors are pre -positioning false narratives in ways that are similar to the pre -positioning of ",
"malware and other software code. They are then launching broad -based and simultaneous ",
"“reporting” of these narratives from government -managed and influenced websites and ",
"amplifying their narratives through technology tools designed to exploit  social media services. ",
"Recent examples include narratives around bio -labs in Ukraine and multiple efforts to obfuscate ",
"military attacks against Ukrainian civilian targets.  ",
" ",
"Due to low barriers to entry into cyberspace it is observed  that less sophisticate d actors can even ",
"undermine  the defence due to availability  of off the shelf tools.  ",
"Investigations by security studies expert on cyber  security  give more weightage  to cyber ",
"offensive actions than cyber defensive measures. They  are of the opinion  that e ver changing ",
"character of cyber threats such as zero day exploits and  capability o f cyber  weapons to attack ",
"surreptitiously  und ermine defence in cyberspace . The stealth nature of cyber wea pons make ",
"them more effective and result uphill task for cyber defensive  measures to dete ct. However ",
"layered or segregation of different information  systems  based on their classification ca n reduce ",
"their vulnerability. How ever such hardened cyber defensive measures  complicates the ease of ",
"use , thus defeating two primary object ives  of information system s i.e. connectivity and ",
"availability.  There lies root dilemma; an impregnable system is inaccessible to legitimate users ",
"whereas an accessible machine is inherently vulnerable to pernicious code.  Hence pr imitive  ",
"studies  of cyber  security greatly emphasize on gaining ascendance in cyber offensive  ",
"capabilities.  ",
" ",
" ",
"Ukraine learnt lesson from 2014 cyber -attacks. The country hardened its cyber infrast ructure and ",
"launched cyber  strategy in 2016  to streamline efforts to avert recurrence  of cyber debacle . The ",
"strategy pledged  to complete implementation by year 2020.  The country also went into cyber ",
"security cooperation  with allied countries as well as tech companies  to safe guard  its cyber ",
"infrastructure  by incorpora ting robust cyber defensive measures . International cooperation  ",
"facilitated Ukraine to relocate  its cyber critical infrastruct ure  to safer places of friendly nation ",
"states without compromising connectivity and access.  ",
" ",
"Recent advances in cyber threat intelligence and end -point protection have helped Ukraine  ",
"withstand a high percentage of destruc tive Russian cyber -attacks . Artificial intelligence based ",
"threat  intelligence systems are help ful for early detection of cyber threats. In this regard the ",
"country has  been benefited  by western  tech companies  such as Microsoft .  ",
" ",
"Moreover, Internet -connected end -point protection  has made it possible to distribute protective ",
"software code quickly both  to cloud services and other connected computing devices to identify ",
"and disable malware.  ",
" ",
"Ukraine with the assistance of western tech giants such as Microsoft is able to ear ly detect  ",
"Russian cyber influence operations. Sophisticated systems based on AI and broader data sets and ",
"availability of inc reasing growin g expert staff is helping to forecast  and mitigate  influencing ",
"cyber threats.  Social networking platforms including Facebook and Twitter  has removed  some suspicious accounts associated with Russian government and were used to for influencin g ",
"operations.  ",
" ",
"For cyber defense, the conflict in Ukraine is instructive. Ukraine cyber defensive measures ",
"ushered a new era in cyber security. International cooperation, public private partnership and ",
"well -orchestrated  cyber strategy has ostensibly helped  Ukraine  to thwart a bigger challenge ",
"which could have consequential effects on outcome of the war.  ",
" ",
"Nation states such as Pakistan can be benefited  from inference of cyber conflict between Russia ",
"and Ukraine. Pakistan has been targeted  by different hostile agencies. Malicious disinformation  ",
"campaigns were launched. However it is heartening fact that country has withstand all these ",
"endeavors to compromise its cyber structure.  ",
" ",
" According to a UN DP report, Pakistan is currently one of the yo ungest  population  in the  ",
"world and the second youngest in the South Asian region after Afghanistan.  Out of the total ",
"population in the country, 64 per cent is below the age of 30, and 29 per cent is between the ",
"ages of 15 -29 years. The country has a reasonably good literacy rate  of almost 63% . Thus ",
"the country  is well poised to harness  emerging  technologies such as AI and bi g data analytics to ",
"counter e ver changing cyber  threat landscape.  A robust national level cyber strategy will play ",
"pivotal role to steer national efforts to safeguard critical cyber infrastructures.  International ",
"cooperation for relocating cyber infrastructure at the time of crisis ca n be further explored ",
"without compromising access and connectivity.  ",
